## Introduction
ShadowDiffusion addresses shadow removal by proposing a unified diffusion framework, dubbed ShadowDiffusion, that integrates both the image and degradation priors for highly effective shadow removal. ShadowDiffusion progressively refines the estimated shadow mask as an auxiliary task of the diffusion generator, which leads to more accurate and robust shadow-free image generation. For more details, please refer to our [original paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.04711.pdf).

To improve both efficiency and effectiveness, we propose two key contributions: (1) integrating the Nonlinear Activation Free Network (NAFNet) as the degradation prior within the diffusion framework. This combines NAFNetâ€™s efficient deterministic modeling with the stochastic generative capacity of diffusion models, leveraging their complementary strengths for high-quality, detail-preserving reconstructions. (2) optimizing the penalty parameter in the unrolling process, yielding improved restoration quality without additional training cost. Our improved model, ShadowDiffusion+, is evaluated on two public shadow removal datasets. On the SRD dataset, it improves PSNR from 34.73 dB to 36.01 dB and SSIM from 0.970 to 0.979, demonstrating both accuracy and efficiency.

## Pretrained NAFNet

Please download the corresponding pretrained model and modify the `resume_state` and `degradation_model_path` (optional) in `shadow.json`.


## Test
You can directly test the performance of the pre-trained model as follows
1. Modify the paths to dataset and pre-trained model. You need to modify the following path in the `shadow.json` 
```python
resume_state # pretrain model or training state -- Line 12
dataroot # validation dataset path -- Line 30
```
2. Test the model
```python
python sr.py -p val -c config/shadow_SRD.json
```
We use the DDIM sampling to speed up the inference stage. The number of steps can be set by `T_sampling` as 5 or 25.

## Train
1. Download datasets and set the following structure
```
|-- SRD_Dataset
    |-- train
        |-- train_A # shadow image
        |-- train_B # shadow mask
        |-- train_C # shadow-free GT
    |-- test
        |-- test_A # shadow image
        |-- test_B # shadow mask
        |-- test_C # shadow-free GT
```
2. You need to modify the following terms in `option.py`
```python
"resume_state": null # if train from scratch
"dataroot"   # training and testing set path
"gpu_ids": [0] # Our model can be trained using a single RTX A5000 GPU. You can also train the model using multiple GPUs by adding more GPU ids in it.
```
3. Train the diffsuion network
```python
python sr.py -p train -c config/shadow.json
```
4. Train the NAFNet network
```python
python train_NAFNet.py -p train -c config/shadow.json
```
## Evaluation
The results reported in the paper are calculated by the `matlab` script used in [previous method](https://github.com/zhuyr97/AAAI2022_Unfolding_Network_Shadow_Removal/tree/master/codes). Details refer to evaluation.m.
